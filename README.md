# Learn by Example: Vue

This tutorial is aimed for you to understand minimum knowledge to quickly to get started into a project.  
Its started when I used to code with Vue but forget almost everything after several months I didn't code with Vue at all.  
So I create this tutorial for me to remember quickly the minimum knowledge I need to become productive enough again with Vue.  
I hope you can learn from this too.
